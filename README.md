# miniRT
### About 
The goal of this project is to create a simple raytracer which handles simple geometric shapes, diffuse reflection, shadows, and light.
We have made some bonuses, such as specular reflection, reflection (mirror), colored lights, and being able to move in the world.

### Setting Up
The program can be tested on any Mac or Linux distribution with the MinilibX installed - the very basic library allowed for our first projects at 42.

* On the school's computers: there is not much to do. Run ``make`` from ``./miniRT``.

* Mac OS X
  * To install the MinilibX, follow the instructions from this link : [minilibx-mac-osx](https://github.com/dannywillems/minilibx-mac-osx)

* Linux
  * To install the MinilibX, follow the instructions from this link : [minilibx-linux](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)
  * After installing all the necessary libraries. Clone the repo from the previous link into ``./miniRT`` , and compile it using the ``./configure`` script.

### Usage
Type ``./miniRT`` followed by the map of your choice as a parameter.\
    **e.g.** ``./scenes/[something].rt``

* ``w, a, s, d`` keys are used to move around.
* ``j, k`` are used to modify the angle of the vertical axis.
* ``ctrl, space`` are used to go down/up along the vertical axis.
